# 🏠 Airbnb Price Predictor — ML Lifecycle & Cloud Integration

This project showcases an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict Airbnb listing prices based on user inputs like city, room type, amenities, and more. It encapsulates the full ML lifecycle using **MLflow** and deploys a Flask-based web application to **Render**, offering dynamic model interaction through a **RESTful API**.
